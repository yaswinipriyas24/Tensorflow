# Student Marks Prediction using TensorFlow

## ðŸ“– *Project Overview*

This is a simple machine learning project where we use *TensorFlow* to build and train a regression model that predicts student marks based on hours studied. Itâ€™s designed for beginners to understand how machine learning models are built, trained, and used for predictions using TensorFlowâ€™s Sequential API.

The project walks through:
- Dataset preparation
- Model creation
- Compilation with loss and optimizer
- Model training
- Evaluation and prediction
- Visualization of results

This project helps learners understand the fundamentals of neural networks, loss functions, optimizers, and how data types and shapes influence learning.

## ðŸŸ  *Problem Statement*

The task is to predict student marks based on the number of hours studied using a simple neural network.

- *Input:* Hours studied (numerical feature)
- *Output:* Marks obtained (continuous target)

The goal is to train the model to learn the relationship and predict marks for new input values.

## ðŸ“‚ *Dataset*

The dataset is small and manually created for demonstration purposes:

```python
X = [2, 3, 5, 7, 8]   # Hours studied
Y = [10, 15, 25, 35, 40]  # Marks obtained
